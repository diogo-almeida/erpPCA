\description{
This package implements the set of recommendations laid out by
Jurgen Kayser and Craig E. Tenke on a series of publications (see references
below) on how to optimize the decomposition of Event-Related Potential (ERP)
data into useful latent factors. These authors propose a PCA decomposition of
an ERP data matrix based on its unstandardized covariance matrix, followed by
a Varimax rotation of all of its principal components, in an attempt to find
simpler latent factors that may correspond to the event-related potentials
that researchers using EEG/MEG are interesting in measuring.

The proposed workflow involves the decomposition of the ERP matrix in its
principal components using the unstandardized covariance matrices of the
original ERP data matrix followed by a Varimax rotation of all of the
principal components (what Kayser and Tenke call an ``unrestricted''
solution).
