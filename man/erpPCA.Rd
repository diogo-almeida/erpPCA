\usage{
erpPCA(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix. This is the data matrix to be decomposed into its
  principal components. For a temporal decomposition (ie., latent factors
  will correspond to time courses), the matrix should be organized
  with ERP waveforms of each sensor in rows (cases) and time samples in
  columns (variables). For spatial decomposition (ie., latent factors
  will correspond to scalp topographies), the matrix should be organized
  with time samples in rows (cases) and sensors in columns (variables).}
}
\value{
This function returns a list containing the unrotated principal
  component loadings, the Varimax rotated factor loadings in a
  variables-by-factors matrix, the factor scores obtained for the rotated
  factors in a cases-by-factors matrix. It also outputs the Eingenvalues
  of the covariance matrix and the their explained variance before and after
  rotation.

\item{Unrotated}{Matrix containing the unrotated principal components
loadings.}

\item{Rotated}{Matrix containing the varimax rotated factor loadings}

\item{Factor.Scores}{Matrix containing the factor scores of the varimax
rotated factor loadings.}

\item{Variance}{Matrix containing the Eigenvalues and explained variance
before and afte rotation.}
}
\description{
This function implements a PCA decomposition of a data matrix
based on its unstandardized covariance matrix, followed by a Varimax rotation
of all of its principal components, in an attempt to find simpler latent
factors.
}
\details{
This workflow of matrix decomposition followed by Varimax rotation
  has been advocated for electrophysiological studies on humans using the
  Event-Related Potential (ERP) technique by Jurgen Kayser and Craig E.
  Tenke. These authors suggest that very good results can be obtained by
  using (1) unstandardized covariance matrices of the original data matrix
  followed by (2) a Varimax rotation of all of the principal components (what
  they call an ``unrestricted'' rotation). The arguments are laid out in a
  series of papers (see references below)

This function is a R port of the original MATLAB function erpPCA.m created
by Jurgen Kayser. According to the original documentation, it implements
``the PCA agorithms used by BMDP-4M (Dixon, 1992) and SPSS 10.0 FACTOR''. The
original MATLAB code can be freely downloaded at
