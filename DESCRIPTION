Description: This package implements the set of recommendations laid out by 
  Jurgen Kayser and Craig E. Tenke on a series of publications (see references 
  in manual) on how to optimize the decomposition of Event-Related Potential 
  (ERP) data into useful latent factors. These authors propose a PCA 
  decomposition of an ERP data matrix based on its unstandardized covariance 
  matrix, followed by a Varimax rotation of all of its principal components, in 
  an attempt to find simpler latent factors that may correspond to the 
  event-related potentials that researchers using EEG/MEG are interesting in 
  measuring.
