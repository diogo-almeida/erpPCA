# erpPCA

R port of MATLAB functions erpPCA.m and others created by Jürgen Kayser. The original MATLAB functions can be freely downloaded from http://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/mmedia/Kayser2003a/Appendix.html

## Scope

This package implements only the PCA + Varimax rotation workflow advocated by Kayser and Tenke (2003, 2005, 2006) for Event-Related Potential (ERP) data, and is *not* a general approach to PCA nor to factor analysis.

A more flexible factor analysis approach to ERP data can be found in the ERP PCA Toolkit by Joseph Dien (Dien, 2010a), which is available only in MATLAB. Perhaps a future version of this package will implement some aspects of this more flexible approach, namely:

* The ability to use different rotations (especially Promax, as recommended by Dien (2010b, Dien et al., 2007)

* The ability to extract and rotate only a user-defined number of factors.

The R ecosystem already provides plenty of PCA and factor analyses packages that can probably be co-opted for these purposes.
