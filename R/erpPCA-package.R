#' @title Unrestricted, unstandardized covariance-based PCA with Varimax 
#' rotation for Event-Related Potentials (ERPs).
#' 
#' @description This package implements the set of recommendations laid out by
#' J\"{u}rgen Kayser and Craig E. Tenke on a series of publications (see references 
#' below) on how to optimize the decomposition of Event-Related Potential (ERP)
#' data into useful latent factors. These authors propose a PCA decomposition of
#' an ERP data matrix based on its unstandardized covariance matrix, followed by
#' a Varimax rotation of all of its principal components, in an attempt to find 
#' simpler latent factors that may correspond to the event-related potentials 
#' that researchers using EEG/MEG are interesting in measuring.
#' 
#' The proposed workflow involves the decomposition of the ERP matrix in its 
#' principal components using the unstandardized covariance matrices of the 
#' original ERP data matrix followed by a Varimax rotation of all of the 
#' principal components (what Kayser and Tenke call an ``unrestricted'' 
#' solution).
